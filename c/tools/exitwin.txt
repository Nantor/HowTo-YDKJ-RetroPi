Exiting and restarting Windows

Here are two small utilities for control of Windows from a shortcut.

ExitWin.exe performs the same job as the Shutdown dialog. It accepts a single upper-case parameter that determines its operation:

    DOS - exists to the MS-DOS prompt
    RESTART - restarts Windows
    REBOOT - reboots the computer
