This document describes the procedure in which you can use to restore from
a previous version of the Windows display driver.  Since the drivers in this
end-user BBS are intended for generic S3 based video cards, it is imperative 
that your current driver is saved in case you encounter difficulties.  

A.  To determine which S3 video chipset is equipped in your video card or
    system, please follow the procedure listed below.

    1.  Consult the owner's manual that was supplied by your video card or
	system.

    OR

    2.  In any DOS prompt, run the Microsoft diagnostic utility that comes
	with DOS called MSD.  Click on the video button and take note of the
	chipset number.  This number should start with 86C.

    OR
    
    3.  Call the manufacturer's technical support department on how to 
	identify the S3 video chipset in your PC.

B.  If the drivers that you are currently using came in floppies with the
    video card, and you still have them, then you can skip the save and go straight to the restore 
    section in C.

C.  Otherwise, please following the procedure listed below to create the
    necessary backup floppy.

    1.  Create a blank & formatted 3.5" or 5.25" floppy.  

    2.  Copy the system.ini file from your Windows sub-directory to the 
	floppy.  All examples below assume the floppy is in drive A: and 
	that Windows files are in a directory called Windows on drive C: 

	For example:  copy c:\windows\system.ini a:

    3.  Copy all the following files from the \windows\system sub-directory
	to the floppy.  

	For 86C911/924, copy the following files: 
	
	CAR6515.DRV

	After you have all the files copied onto a floppy, you are done.  
	Please place the floppy in a safe place.

D.  To restore a driver from you board or system manufacturer's original 
    disk, follow the directions supplied with the disk.   

E.  If you need to restore the driver from the floppy that was created 
    previously, please follow the steps listed below.  All examples below 
    assume the floppy is in drive A: and that Windows files are in a 
    directory called Windows on drive C: 

    1.  From the floppy, copy the file system.ini to your windows directory.
	
	For example: 

	copy a:\system.ini c:\windows

	{enter yes when DOS asks you replace the original file}

     2. Copy the remanding files onto the \windows\system sub-directory.

	For example,

	copy a:\*.drv c:\windows\system
	copy a:\*.386 c:\windows\system
	copy a:\*.??r c:\windows\system
	copy a:\*.exe c:\windows\system  {this is for 928 only}

    This should conclude the restoration process.
